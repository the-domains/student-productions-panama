Gigi Rodriguez - Board President / Co-founder

Hello

Roberto Esquenazi - Board Secretary / Co-founder

Once upon a time in a far away land a child was born. That child was me and the land was Panama City, Panama. I have participated in my first play at the age of 10 and have been participating in plays and musicals since then. I have participated in over 10 plays and musicals, with the most recent being West Side Story (2016), The Sound of Music (2015), Sin Tu Cari√±o (2015) and many more. In August 2016, I had the honor of participating and producing RENT: School Edition and fell in love with production ever since. I founded this organization along side the other board members to keep producing theatre in Panama because I saw the power that theatre had on the society.
