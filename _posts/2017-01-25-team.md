Roberto Esquenazi - President and Co-Founder

> Once upon a time in a far away land a child was born. That child was me and the land was Panama City, Panama. I did my first play at the young age of 10 and haven't stopped ever since. All in all, I have participated in over 10 plays and musicals, with the most recent being West Side Story (2016), The Sound of Music (2015), Sin Tu CariÃ±o (2015) and many more. In August 2016, I had the honor of acting in and producing RENT: School Edition and fell in love with production since then. I founded this organization along side the other board members to keep producing theatre in Panama because I saw the power that theatre had on society as a whole. And that is what NIU is all about.

Gigi Rodriguez - Secretary and Co-Founder

> Howdy. Not to brag or anything, but I am the most seasoned out of the board members when it comes to acting. I started acting at the age of 8 and I've been in every play and musical my school did. The most recent productions I have participated in were West Side Story (2016), Beauty and The Beast (2015) and Fuenteovejuna (2015). I also directed Rent: School Edition (2016) and have attended various directing and acting workshops over the years. NIU and theatre in general, for me, are a way of communicating ideas that may change the world someday, because theatre rocked my world completely.

Tito Vallarino - Treasurer and Co-Founder

> Greetings earthlings (or aliens. I don't judge). I am an experienced actor and set designer/builder and a new-found entrepreneur. I have built a lot of sets over the years for school productions and professional productions. Recently, I've built the sets for West Side Story (2016), Rent: School Edition (2016), and Bang Bang You're Dead (2017). I founded this company mostly because Roberto and Gigi forced me to join, but I do share their ideals of theatre and the effect it has on people. NIU is a new way to look at theatre from different points of view and therefore shift the existing paradigms in Panama regarding theatre as a whole.
