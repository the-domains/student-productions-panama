  Hairspray tells the story of a dance-loving teen Tracy Turnblad who auditions
  for a spot on "The Corny Collins Show" and wins. She becomes an overnight
  celebrity, a trendsetter in dance, fun and fashion. Perhaps her new status as
  a teen sensation is enough to topple Corny's reigning dance queen and bring
  racial integration to the show. Set in 1960s Baltimore.

Hairspray tells the story of a dance-loving teen Tracy Turnblad who auditions for a spot on "The Corny Collins Show" and wins. She becomes an overnight celebrity, a trendsetter in dance, fun and fashion. Perhaps her new status as a teen sensation is enough to topple Corny's reigning dance queen and bring racial integration to the show. Set in 1960s Baltimore.

## Scoring Criteria

### Scenery - 6

The scenery for this piece was largely dictated by the venue. It was also based heavily on the Broadway production and consisted of several movable flats (3) and two stationary set pieces that opened to create the various settings of the musical. The movable set pieces and flats felt really heavy and sometimes unnecessary, as with the lighting and the text itself the audience could infer where the characters were. Still, it was beautifully crafted and the SL flat even included a picture of the actual Dynamites, which was a pretty cool touch.

### Lights - 6.5

The lighting for Hairspray felt too heavy to bear; with 3 VLX wash lights, 8 spots, 2 gobo rotators, and too many movable heads to count it was simply too much. On top of that, the team decided to add a led border to the entire stage. This was a cool aspect of the light design, as it lit up whenever the characters found themselves in the Corny Collins Show. However, the most of the lights were incongruous of what was happening on stage; it was like seeing a light show while people were doing less important things on stage. Score given:

### Props - 9.5

The props were one of the most memorable aspects of this production: from individually tagged Hairspray cans to prison bars made out of metal (or at least, that's how they looked). The props were all used thoughtfully and, thankfully, sparingly. The image of Edma Turnblad using that phone is still deeply etched in my brain. Simply iconic.

### Sound - 5.7

The sound design of this musical was blah; let me elaborate. I understand that the sound engineer had 36 mics at the same time, but this is no excuse for such a dirty mix. The mix consisted of the music underwhelmingly low at some instances, some voices in vocal harmony parts being lost due to poor sound mixing, and overall averageness. The sound did not evoke a single feeling apart from the ocassional laugh provided by Edma, Tracy, Link, Penny or otherwise. Still, it is not below the Panamanian standard but for a techie like me it really bugged me.

### Wardrobe - 6

The costumes worn in this piece were, due to a lack of a better word, average. This is not to say that they were terribly constructed, because they were pretty okay. However, some characters had more thought put into them. Tracy's wigs were half as beautiful and detailed as Edma's wigs. Tracy didn't stand out, while Edma and Motormouth did. Link's costume was similar to everyone else's at the Corny Collin's Show. And the list goes on.

### Acting - 9 / Singing - 8.5 / Dancing - 9 / Casting - 7.5

This musical was fun because of the cast. The cast made it 1000 times better in every way possible. They were all great actors, even the ensemble, they were all on tune, on tempo on everything and the dance moves were stupidly complicated. Yet, they all managed to power through. I will say that I have my reservations with the casting choice of Link; I feel he needed a little bit more of "it." If you saw him, you'd know what I mean. Tracy's acting was a little off, but I attribute that to misdirection or lack thereof. She moved like an old lady and not an energetic teenager. Singing wise, everyone was pretty good, except the woman who played Velma von Tussle. She didn't belt the only high note in her song and, needless to say, I was disappointed. Nevertheless, it was a great cast overall although there were some minor flops. Thank god no white washing happened, or I would be writing a very different review.

### Management - 8

Dressers and backstage crew deserve all the applause and then some. This show has a lot of tricky changes, of wardrobe and scenery and all of them were done perfectly. Stage management wise there were some areas that it was lacking. Some light cues were late, some were too early. Other times mics didn't enter at the time that they were supposed to etc. However, I understand that it is a big production and that things can go wrong.

### Miscellaneous - 7

There was a lot of haze on stage, off stage, pretty much everywhere. It was a breathing hazard sometimes. There was also a very low hanging light bar with movable heads - that meant little visibility when people where standing upstage, form where I was sitting anyways. The actors used a highly flammable item onstage and the day I went it went a little wrong. I am sure that the production didn't hold a fire permit, but my heart stopped for a split second when, after spraying a can of hairspray into a lighter to "melt" the prison bars, there was a little flame still coming out of the opening. Thank LINK who masterfully put it out before, you know, we all died.

## Final Score: 8.27
