### ABOUT AUDITIONS

These auditions will be for consideration to perform in both Theory of Relativity and 21 Chump Street.

### IF YOU HAVE A CHARACTER IN MIND

Sing a song that your character sings. We suggest learning one song from Theory of Relativity and one song from 21 Chump Street. You may be asked to sing additional songs, so be sure to learn more than what is asked for.

### IF YOU DON'T HAVE A CHARACTER IN MIND

Choose a song that showcases your vocal range as well as hip-hop/rap and musical theatre singing styles. We recommend learning a rap song from other Lin-Manuel Miranda musicals (Hamilton, In The Heights etc.) or one from 21 Chump Street. The musical theatre style may be fulfilled by regular musical theatre canon (Sondheim, Webber, Rodgers & Hammerstein etc.)
